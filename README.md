This is the project of the website created for our team - Happydoomsday.
I wanted to create a simple but extensible website showcasing our projects.
The technology stack for this project is:

**React + Gatsby + Styled Components**

I was responsible for designing a layout as well as implementing it.

It is still work in progress and we will change and add some things, but it was important to us to create the base version that will be uploaded to the server, while we are working on our projects.

### If you want to checkout the App
To download the dependencies run:
```npm install```

To start the application use:
``` gatsby develop ```

To build the application use:
